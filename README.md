PuzzleSheets
============
A tool to parse .puz files. It can be used to:
1. Print out the clues and grid in a format friendly for copy+paste (into a spreadsheet).
2. Write an XLSX file directly.

Installation
------------
1. Clone or download [the code](https://github.com/bsravanin/PuzzleSheets).
1. Run the following commands from a terminal:
   1. `cd PuzzleSheets`
   1. `tox -e py39`

Usage
-----
1. `source .tox/py39/bin/activate`
1. To see all options: `./puzzle_sheets/puzzle_sheets.py -h`


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
A couple of issues that I have run into:

1. When the XLSX generated by this tool is copy+pasted from macOS Numbers into a Google Sheet, the formatting is not
   being preserved.
2. When the XLSX generated by this tool is imported into a Google Sheet using its File -> Import option, all existing
   style in the sheet is being reset to Calibri in size 10.
