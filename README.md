KNOWN ISSUES
------------
A couple of issues that I have run into:

1. When the XLSX generated by this tool is copy+pasted from macOS Numbers into a Google Sheet, the formatting is not
   being preserved.
2. When the XLSX generated by this tool is imported into a Google Sheet using its File -> Import option, all existing
   style in the sheet is being reset to Calibri in size 10.
